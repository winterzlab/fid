<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new
cooking technique called <q>sous vide</q>. In <dfn>sous vide
cooking</dfn>, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
in plastic) into a water bath that is <em>precisely
set to the target temperature</em> you want the food
to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>,
Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature
poaching.</p><br>
<p><b>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon
with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef
table, contact us before November 30.</b></p><br>

pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
immunity issues.</small></p>
